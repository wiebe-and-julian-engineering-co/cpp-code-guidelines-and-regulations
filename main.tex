\section{Introduction}
C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has a wide vocabulary of
features, some of which are inspired by other language and some inspired other
languages. C++ is commonly called a superset of C, which in many respects
is true.\\
Because of the nature of being a superset of C, C++ has many close-to-the-
hardware programming capabilities. These low-level capabilities must be handled
with discipline and sanity. This document is used as a guide and reference for
C++ programmers in \textit{Wiebe and Julian Engineering Co.} to achieve sane and safe
C++ programs.\\
Many C++ programming aspects are evaluated in this document, included but not
limited by: readability, maintainability, portability, efficiency and security.

\section{C++ Code Guidelines and Regulations}
\subsection{Reading Guide}
This section describes how the guides and regulations should be read and
interpreted. There are a couple of keywords that denote the urgency of
following a requirement. Such as:
\bigbreak
\textbf{Test:} Hello world
\subsection{Credility}
Thoughout this document, authors and books are referenced to support the
underlying guideline, in order to maintain credibility.
\subsubsection{C++ Versioning}
This guide takes modern C++ as of C++17 into account for coding practices. But
some platforms may not have any compilers with support for the latest C++
version available. Since some practices may be banned in C++17 while they might
be advised to use in C++14. These rules will be annotated with \cppuntil{14},
\cppsince{17} or both. This may be applied with any C++ version.
