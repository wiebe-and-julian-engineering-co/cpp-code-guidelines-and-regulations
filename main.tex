\section{Introduction}
C++ is a general-purpose programming language. It has a wide vocabulary of
features, some of which are inspired by other language and some inspired other
languages. C++ is commonly called a superset of C, which in many respects
is true.\\
Because of the nature of being a superset of C, C++ has many close-to-the-
hardware programming capabilities. These low-level capabilities must be handled
with discipline and sanity. This document is used as a guide and reference for
C++ programmers in Wiebe and Julian Engineering Co. to achieve sane and safe
C++ programs.\\
Many aspects are evaluated in this document, included but not limited by:
readability, maintainability, portability, efficiency and security.
